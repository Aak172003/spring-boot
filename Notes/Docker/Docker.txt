contanarize the application using docker 
Here codebase know to a container

Docker solves the problem of dependency management , compatablity issues , environmental consitency by providing with contanarization
It enables developer to pack their application and the dependencies into container , and this ensure consistent execution in different host system 
And it elimates all the version conflict here 



contanarization is a light weight virtualization technolofythat enables you to pack our applicationalong with it's dependencies into a standard unit which is called conatiner 
And with docker we can create conatiner that have everything that is needed for an application to run , 
now this can include the code , the run-time libraries and even the system tools

And this conatiners are portable ,which means you can move them accross the system and can be deployed in any system that supports docker or has docker up and running .
Now This ensures that the same conatiner which is running on my system will work on someone else system in the same way like it was runnung on my system  
This ensure consistency
