when i set shuddown endppoint which means i am talking about graceful shuddown 

GraceFul ShutDown -> means it will complete all the ongoing request before the actual shutdown takes place 

We can't find shutdown in http://localhost:8080/actuator this endpoint , because by default shutdown is diable we can't see 
because anyone get this shutdown endoint then they can be able to shutdown the application 

Also get request is not enable by default

Exposing shutdown endpoint is quite risky because anyone can be shutdown your application , 
so make sure if request goes comes your company ip address then this will execute
