Containerize the Application Using Docker

The codebase is now containerized.

Docker solves the problems of dependency management, compatibility issues, and environmental consistency by providing containerization.  
It enables developers to package their applications along with all dependencies into a container, ensuring consistent execution across different host systems.  
This eliminates version conflicts.

Containerization is a lightweight virtualization technology that enables you to package your application along with its dependencies into a standard unit called a **container**.  
With Docker, we can create containers that include everything needed for the application to runâ€”such as the code, runtime, libraries, and even system tools.

These containers are **portable**, meaning they can be moved across systems and deployed on any machine that supports Docker or has Docker running.  
This ensures that the same container running on one machine will run exactly the same on another machine.  

This guarantees consistency.

Hypervisor

A **hypervisor** enables us to interact with and manage **virtual machines (VMs)**.
